# Multi-platform, multi-board and PlatformIO 

One of the many great things about PlatformIO is its ability to have projects  
that build and run on several platforms simultaneously. This project does this.   

It provides a starting point for those who need it and runs on:
* Platforms
  * Native
  * ESP-IDF
  * Arduino
* Hardware
  * PC (Linux/MacOs/Windows)
  * LILYGOÂ® TTGO LoRa32 V1.0
  * T-Beam Meshtastic V1.1 ESP32 LoRa SX1276/SX1278
  * Arduino Uno Rev3

It has:
* *One* runnable main.c for all platforms
* Unit testing
  * Local on the native platform
  * And running on the boards


# Making it work for you

All changes are, hopefully, in platform.ini

1. Change the serial id:s to your own:  
`/dev/cu.wchusbserialNNNNNNNNN`  
You'll find it in PIO Home - Devices  
*(no, the serial ids of my test boards are hardly attack vectors)*
2. Add your own board's configuration in an `[env:yourboard]`-section
3. Go do great things!



# Tips & takeaways

1. The build times are *very* different for the different platforms. 
2. Arduino don't have to have a `main.cpp`..
3. ..because we only need .cpp when we need c++ features  
   like `Serial.begin(9600)` for Arduino to be able to log.
4. Config 
  * `platformio.ini`
    * Both Arduino and Native needs lib_extra_dirs = components
    * Native platform need `lib_compat_mode = off`.  
      I am have not found out why for sure. Any ideas?

5. Start using the command line, unless you *really* like clicking
  * `pio run` - Builds all
  * `pio test` - Runs all tests
  * `pio clean` won't work...but..
  * `pio -t clean` and `pio -t cleanall` - Cleans all targets.
